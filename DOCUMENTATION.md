# Project Documentation: smile-admin

This document summarizes the project state as of 2025-12-06 and how to get it running locally. It is generated from the repository metadata (`composer.json`, `composer.lock`, `package.json`, README).

- **Composer**: used to manage PHP dependencies. Use Composer 2.x.
- **Node.js & npm / pnpm / yarn**: required for frontend build (Vite). `package.json` uses Vite (v7) and Tailwind.

(For a complete, exact dependency tree and all versions, see `composer.lock`.)

**Frontend / JS packages (`package.json`)**
- Type: `module`, private project
- `devDependencies` (selected):
  - `vite` `^7.0.7`
  - `laravel-vite-plugin` `^2.0.0`

  - `axios` `^1.11.0`
  - `concurrently` `^9.0.1`
  - `postcss` `^8.4.31`

**Scripts**
- Composer (from `composer.json`):
  - `setup`: installs dependencies, copies `.env`, generates app key, migrates, installs npm, builds assets
  - `dev`: runs `php artisan serve`, `php artisan queue:listen`, and `npm run dev` concurrently (via `npx concurrently`)
  - `test`: clears config cache and runs `@php artisan test`

- NPM (from `package.json`):
  - `build`: `vite build`
  - `dev`: `vite`

**Common Setup / Run Commands**
1. Install PHP dependencies:

   ```powershell
   composer install
   ```

2. Copy and configure environment file, generate key:

   ```powershell
   copy .env.example .env; php artisan key:generate
   ```

3. Run database migrations (make sure DB config in `.env` is set):

   ```powershell
   php artisan migrate
   ```

   - Note: repo includes migrations in `database/migrations/`.

4. Install JS dependencies and build/run assets:

   ```powershell
   npm install
   npm run dev    # for local development (Vite dev server)
   npm run build  # for production assets
   ```

5. Run the app locally (development):

   ```powershell
   php artisan serve
   ```

6. Run tests:

   ```powershell
   php artisan test
   # or if you use Pest directly:
   ./vendor/bin/pest
   ```

**Database & Migrations**
- Migration files are in `database/migrations/`. Example migration filenames in this repo include:
  - `2025_12_05_090000_create_college_info_table.php`
  - `2025_12_05_100000_create_course_table.php`
  - `2025_12_05_110000_create_course_topics_table.php`
  - (and others under `database/migrations/`)

**Important Directories**
- `app/` — core application code (Controllers, Models, Livewire components, Requests, Providers)
- `resources/views/` — Blade views (the current file you were editing: `resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php`)
- `database/` — migrations, seeders, factories
- `routes/` — route definitions (e.g., `web.php`, `admin.php`, `college.php`, `student.php`)
- `public/` — public web directory and built assets
- `tests/` — unit and feature tests (Pest configured)

**Notes & Next Steps**
- Exact versions for every dependency are recorded in `composer.lock` and `package-lock.json` (or the lockfile generated by your JS package manager). Consult those files for reproducible installs.
- If you want, I can:
  - Commit `DOCUMENTATION.md` and open a PR/commit the change.
  - Generate a more detailed inventory (full dependency list extracted from `composer.lock`).
  - Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with developer workflow and branching rules.
